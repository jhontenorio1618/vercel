# Professional Bio Website

This is a simple personal bio website built to practice the fundamentals of deploying a web application with Vercel. The site aims to deliver a professional overview of my background, skills, projects, and education. I have prior experience with Git and GitHub through personal projects and internships, but this was my first time using Vercel as a deployment platform. The process allowed me to gain confidence in pushing code to production and to better understand how deployment tools fit into the broader development lifecycle.

Something I learned from this assignment was the importance of CI/CD pipelines. While I had previously worked with CI/CD pipelines, this project gave me hands-on insight into its value. I learned how automation reduces the need for repetitive manual steps, decreases the likelihood of human error, and ensures consistency across environments. For example, for this assignment, I had to do most things manually, when usually a CI/CD pipeline would do several things by just running it using a workflow.  I would normally commit code to GitHub, and Vercel would automatically handle the deployment process.

Although the main goal of the project was deployment practice, I also paid attention to user experience. While I was testing the site, I realized that some elements of the site did not display as smoothly on mobile devices as they did on desktop. Even though mobile responsiveness was not the primary focus of the assignment, I pushed myself to improve usability for mobile users. This required me to adjust layout elements, rework some CSS, and think critically about how a simple bio site should look and feel across different devices. While I did not perfect mobile responsiveness, the process highlighted the importance of designing with multiple platforms in mind and encouraged me to keep learning about responsive design techniques.

This assignment also helped me reflect on how personal projects can mirror professional workflows. I saw how GitHub version control integrates seamlessly with deployment platforms like Vercel and how these tools align with industry practices. I also noticed the importance of treating even small projects as opportunities to practice professional standards.

Overall, this project reinforced the value of hands-on practice in building confidence with new tools. By deploying a personal bio website, I not only created a simple online portfolio but also gained practical experience with application deployment. This project broadened my understanding of how automation supports modern development, an appreciation for the challenges of responsive design, and motivation to continue refining both my technical and design skills in future projects.
